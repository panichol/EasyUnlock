Hello and welcome to my project!
This project is an app meant to use the way people pick up thier phones as a means of authentication.

The actually working project is an android studio project in the EasyUnlock directory.
My attempt to make an app in python is in the PythonAttempt directory.
The data I collected and the tools I used to look at it are in the Collected Data directory.
Ming built an app that can help you collect pickup signals, but it has a few bugs. It's in the DataCollector directory.
Finally, the pretty pictures I made for the poster are in ProjectDocs. 

MORE TO COME
